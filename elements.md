The AKAMAI Finance Academy (AFA) is a five-year program providing specialized training for students in the areas of Investment Banking, Private Equity and Asset Management. Students are actively sought from socioeconomically distressed communities and hired into AKAMAI Capital where they gain real-world experience as Financial Analysts.

About the AKAMAI Finance Academy (AFA) The AKAMAI Finance Academy (AFA) is a 5-year, Asia-focused financial analyst training program that begins in the senior year of high school and runs through the senior year of college. The training program is based on a practical, fully integrated, problem-based, daisy-chained, mentor-protégé learning approach known among Hawaiians as “Ma Ka Hana Ka Ike” which translates to “from the doing comes the knowledge.” During the course of the program, students are taught all of the aspects of long/short equity asset management and then given the chance to repeatedly apply their newfound skills to assist in the operation of a pan-Asia, long/short equity portfolio. Additionally, during the summers, students participate in local finance Internships, travel throughout Asia on a supervised field study and take part in international and/or mainland-based finance internships. Upon graduating from college and completing the AFA, students are placed with an asset management firm to begin their careers. By participating in the AFA during their senior year of high school, students are able to fulfill the Senior Project requirements of the Department of Education’s Recognition Diploma while also earning 6+ college credits through the Running Start program.
